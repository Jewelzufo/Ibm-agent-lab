# Module 4: Fundamentals of Agent Development

## Agent Components: Foundation Models, Tools, Reasoning, and Instructions

AI agents in WatsonX Agent Lab are built using four core components:

1. **Foundation Models**:
   - Pre-trained AI models (e.g., language models, vision models) that serve as the agent's cognitive backbone.
   - Examples: IBM's Granite models, open-source models like GPT.

2. **Tools**:
   - Pre-built or custom functions that enable agents to perform specific tasks (e.g., search, weather lookup, database queries).
   - Tools extend the agent's capabilities beyond the foundation model's inherent abilities.

3. **Reasoning**:
   - The decision-making process that determines how the agent uses tools and responds to inputs.
   - Often implemented using frameworks like **LangGraph** or patterns like **ReAct**.

4. **Instructions**:
   - Clear, concise directives that guide the agent's behavior and purpose.
   - Define the agent's goals, constraints, and interaction style.

## Understanding the Agent Frameworks (LangGraph)

**LangGraph** is a framework for building AI agents that emphasizes modularity and composability. It allows developers to:

- Define **nodes** (e.g., tool calls, model inferences) and **edges** (flow of data between nodes).
- Create complex workflows by chaining nodes together.
- Implement reasoning patterns like **ReAct** (Reason + Act).

## Agent Architectures (ReAct Pattern)

The **ReAct** pattern is a popular architecture for AI agents, combining reasoning and action:

1. **Reason**: The agent analyzes the input and decides which tools to use.
2. **Act**: The agent executes the chosen tools and gathers information.
3. **Observe**: The agent processes the results and iterates if necessary.

This pattern enables agents to handle multi-step tasks and adapt to dynamic environments.

## How Agents Make Decisions and Use Tools

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The agent receives user input or environmental data.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - The agent uses its foundation model and reasoning framework to determine the appropriate action.

3. **Tool Selection**:
   - Based on the reasoning, the agent selects and executes relevant tools.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The agent combines tool results and model inferences to generate a response or action.

5. **Learning and Adaptation**:
   - Over time, the agent may refine its decision-making process based on feedback and new data.

## Key Takeaways

- Agents are built using foundation models, tools, reasoning, and instructions.
- **LangGraph** is a modular framework for designing agent workflows.
- The **ReAct** pattern combines reasoning and action for effective decision-making.
- Agents process inputs, select tools, generate outputs, and adapt over time.
