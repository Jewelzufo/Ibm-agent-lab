# Module 8: Testing and Debugging

## Using the Agent Preview Interface

1. **Access Preview Pane**:
   - Open the **Preview Pane** in the Agent Lab interface to interact with your agent in real-time.

2. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Input various queries and commands to evaluate the agent's responses.
   - Example: Test both typical and edge-case scenarios.

3. **Observe Workflow**:
   - Monitor how the agent processes inputs, uses tools, and generates outputs.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Incorrect Responses**:
   - **Cause**: Poorly defined instructions or misconfigured model parameters.
   - **Solution**: Refine instructions and tune parameters.

2. **Tool Failures**:
   - **Cause**: Incorrect tool configuration or API issues.
   - **Solution**: Verify tool settings and check API status.

3. **Infinite Loops**:
   - **Cause**: Flawed workflow logic or missing termination conditions.
   - **Solution**: Review and adjust the workflow in the **Agent Canvas**.

4. **Latency**:
   - **Cause**: Heavy computation or inefficient tool usage.
   - **Solution**: Optimize tool calls and consider using asynchronous processing.

## Iterative Improvement Process

1. **Collect Feedback**:
   - Gather insights from test interactions and user feedback.

2. **Analyze Performance**:
   - Review logs and metrics to identify areas for improvement.

3. **Refine Agent**:
   - Update instructions, workflow, or tools based on feedback and analysis.

4. **Retest**:
   - Validate changes by retesting the agent in the **Preview Pane**.

## Validating Agent Functionality

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Verify that the agent performs all intended tasks correctly.

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Assess response time, accuracy, and scalability under load.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
   - Test the agent with real users to ensure it meets their needs.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Document test cases, results, and any issues encountered for future reference.

## Key Takeaways

- **Preview Pane**: Use the Preview Pane for real-time testing and interaction.
- **Troubleshooting**: Address common issues like incorrect responses, tool failures, and latency.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine the agent based on feedback and testing.
- **Validation**: Perform functional, performance, and user acceptance testing to ensure reliability.
