# Key Terms in IBM WatsonX and AI Agent Development

## Introduction

This module provides a comprehensive glossary of essential terms related to AI agents and the IBM WatsonX platform. Understanding these key concepts will help you navigate the platform effectively and develop sophisticated AI agents.

## Key Terms Glossary

| Term | Definition | Relevant Module |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **AI Agent** | An autonomous system designed to perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents operate independently, adapt to new data, interact in real-time, and are goal-oriented. | Module 1 |
| **WatsonX** | IBM's comprehensive AI and data platform designed to empower businesses with advanced AI capabilities, integrating various tools and services for AI application development. | Module 2 |
| **WatsonX.ai** | The core component of the WatsonX ecosystem, serving as an enterprise AI studio for building, training, and deploying AI models. | Module 2 |
| **Agent Lab** | A specialized feature within WatsonX.ai designed for building and deploying AI agents with a low-code/no-code interface. | Module 2 |
| **Foundation Models** | Pre-trained AI models (e.g., language models, vision models) that serve as the cognitive backbone of an agent. Examples include IBM's Granite models and open-source models. | Module 4 |
| **Tools** | Pre-built or custom functions that enable agents to perform specific tasks, extending the agent's capabilities beyond the foundation model's inherent abilities. | Module 4 |
| **Reasoning** | The decision-making process that determines how an agent uses tools and responds to inputs, often implemented using frameworks like LangGraph. | Module 4 |
| **Instructions** | Clear, concise directives that guide an agent's behavior and purpose, defining goals, constraints, and interaction style. | Module 4 |
| **LangGraph** | A framework for building AI agents that emphasizes modularity and composability, allowing developers to define nodes and edges to create complex workflows. | Module 4 |
| **ReAct Pattern** | A popular architecture for AI agents that combines reasoning and action in a three-step process: Reason, Act, and Observe. | Module 4 |
| **Agent Canvas** | Visual workspace in Agent Lab where you design and connect agent components (models, tools, and instructions). | Module 3 |
| **Tool Palette** | Library of pre-built tools and options for creating custom tools within the Agent Lab interface. | Module 3 |
| **Preview Pane** | Interactive testing area to preview an agent's behavior in real-time within Agent Lab. | Module 3 |
| **Temperature** | A model parameter that controls the creativity and randomness of responses. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase variety. | Module 7 |
| **Max Tokens** | A model parameter that limits the length of responses generated by the foundation model. | Module 7 |
| **Top-k/Top-p Sampling** | Model parameters that control the diversity and quality of generated responses by limiting the set of tokens considered during text generation. | Module 7 |
| **Pre-built Tools** | Ready-to-use tools provided by IBM (e.g., search, weather, calculator) that can be integrated into agents. | Module 6 |
| **Custom Tools** | Tools developed by users to meet specific requirements, extending the functionality of AI agents beyond pre-built capabilities. | Module 6 |
| **Edge Cases** | Potential scenarios where an agent might fail, such as ambiguous queries or invalid inputs, requiring special handling. | Module 7 |
| **Iterative Improvement** | The continuous process of refining an agent based on feedback, testing, and performance analysis to enhance its functionality and user experience. | Module 8 |

## Key Takeaways
