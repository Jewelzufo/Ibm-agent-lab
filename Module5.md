# Module 5: Creating Your First Agent in Agent Lab

## Step 1: Initiating a New Agent Project

1. **Open Agent Lab**:
   - Navigate to your WatsonX.ai project and open the **Agent Lab** interface.

2. **Create a New Agent**:
   - Click **New Agent** or **+ Create Agent**.
   - Provide a name and optional description for your agent.

## Step 2: Selecting a Foundation Model

1. **Access Model Library**:
   - In the **Configuration Panel**, locate the **Foundation Model** section.

2. **Choose a Model**:
   - Select a pre-trained model (e.g., IBM Granite, GPT) based on your agent's requirements.
   - Consider factors like language support, domain specificity, and computational resources.

## Step 3: Configuring Model Parameters

1. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - Modify settings such as temperature (creativity), max tokens (response length), and top-k/top-p sampling.
   - Fine-tune parameters to align with your agent's purpose and desired behavior.

2. **Save Configuration**:
   - Click **Save** or **Apply** to update the model settings.

## Step 4: Defining Agent Purpose and Instructions

1. **Set Agent Purpose**:
   - In the **Instructions** section, clearly define the agent's primary goal (e.g., "Assist users with weather inquiries").

2. **Write Instructions**:
   - Provide detailed instructions for the agent's behavior, including constraints and examples.
   - Example: "Respond politely and use the weather tool for location-based queries."

## Step 5: Choosing Frameworks and Architecture

1. **Select a Framework**:
   - Choose a framework like **LangGraph** for building the agent's workflow.

2. **Define Architecture**:
   - Implement an architecture like **ReAct** to structure reasoning and tool usage.
   - Drag and drop nodes (e.g., model inference, tool calls) onto the **Agent Canvas** and connect them.

## Step 6: Testing Your Agent in the Preview Pane

1. **Open Preview Pane**:
   - Click on the **Preview** tab to access the testing interface.

2. **Interact with the Agent**:
   - Type in queries or commands to test the agent's responses.
   - Observe how the agent processes inputs, uses tools, and generates outputs.

3. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Make adjustments to instructions, model parameters, or workflow based on test results.

## Key Takeaways

- **Initiate a Project**: Start by creating a new agent in the Agent Lab interface.
- **Select a Model**: Choose a foundation model that aligns with your agent's needs.
- **Configure Parameters**: Fine-tune model settings for optimal performance.
- **Define Purpose and Instructions**: Clearly outline the agent's goals and behavior.
- **Choose Frameworks and Architecture**: Use frameworks like LangGraph and patterns like ReAct.
- **Test in Preview Pane**: Interact with your agent and refine its behavior iteratively.
