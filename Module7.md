# Module 7: Customizing Agent Behavior

## Writing Effective Agent Instructions

1. **Be Clear and Specific**:
   - Define the agent's purpose and goals explicitly.
   - Example: "Assist users with restaurant recommendations based on cuisine and location."

2. **Provide Examples**:
   - Include sample inputs and expected outputs to guide the agent's behavior.
   - Example: "If the user asks for 'Italian restaurants in downtown,' respond with a list of options."

3. **Set Constraints**:
   - Specify limitations or rules for the agent's responses.
   - Example: "Do not recommend restaurants with a rating below 4 stars."

4. **Use Natural Language**:
   - Write instructions in a conversational tone to align with user interactions.

## Tuning Model Parameters for Better Performance

1. **Temperature**:
   - Lower values (e.g., 0.2) for more deterministic responses.
   - Higher values (e.g., 0.8) for creative and varied outputs.

2. **Max Tokens**:
   - Limit response length to ensure concise and relevant answers.

3. **Top-k/Top-p Sampling**:
   - Adjust to control the diversity and quality of generated responses.

## Crafting Prompts That Guide Agent Behavior

1. **Contextual Prompts**:
   - Provide context to help the agent understand the user's intent.
   - Example: "The user is planning a trip and needs hotel recommendations."

2. **Role-Based Prompts**:
   - Assign a role to the agent to shape its tone and style.
   - Example: "You are a travel assistant. Be friendly and helpful."

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Test prompts and refine them based on the agent's responses.

## Handling Edge Cases and Error Recovery

1. **Anticipate Edge Cases**:
   - Identify potential scenarios where the agent might fail (e.g., ambiguous queries).
   - Example: "If the user's request is unclear, ask for more details."

2. **Implement Error Handling**:
   - Add fallback responses for when tools fail or inputs are invalid.
   - Example: "If the Weather Tool is unavailable, respond with 'Sorry, I can't fetch the weather right now.'"

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Track errors and unexpected behaviors for continuous improvement.

## Key Takeaways

- **Effective Instructions**: Write clear, specific, and example-driven instructions.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust model parameters to optimize performance.
- **Prompt Crafting**: Use contextual and role-based prompts to guide behavior.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Anticipate failures and implement error recovery mechanisms.
